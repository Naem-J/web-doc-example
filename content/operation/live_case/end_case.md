When the case is complete, click **End Case**. Recordings stop and the following prompts appear:
1. If any imaging mode changes were made during the case, select **Yes** to save the changes or **No** to delete the changes.
2. If desired, save recorded video. To save a copy of the video to an external hard drive, connect one to a [side panel USB connector](../../additional_information/external_drives).

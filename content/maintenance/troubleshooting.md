If the system exhibits the following symptoms, attempt the corresponding troubleshooting procedures before contacting Technical Services.

##### The image is blurry or out of focus

1. Use the microscope controls to focus the image on-screen.
2. Check to see that the camera is flush on the microscope.
3. Wearing the 3D glasses, close one eye at a time to check the right and left eye focus for the camera.
4. If the image still appears out of focus or blurry, check the [microscope alignment](../basic/microscope_alignment).

##### The colors look wrong

1. In the Quick Access Bar, click **Color Channels** and select **Off**.
2. If necessary, disengage active laser filters.
3. Click **Settings**.
4. Click **Light Profile** and select a light profile.
5. Adjust the color temperature or perform the white balance calibration.

##### The system does not detect the camera.

1. Check the camera cable connections.
2. Ensure the camera LED is on.
3. Disconnect the cable on the camera and plug it back in.
4. If the problem persists, shut down the computer and wait 30 seconds before restarting.

##### The system does not recognize the display

1. Check the cable connections. If necessary, restart the system.
2. Hold the power button on the display until it powers on.

To extend the depth of field and improve performance at high magnification, follow these tips:
* Set camera iris slider to 30% open to extend the depth of field.
* Check the light temperature or white balance settings to verify light calibration.
* Parfocalize visualization (microscope, non-contact, contact) to focus the surgical space.
* Zoom in to fill the display to maximize the quality of surgical view.

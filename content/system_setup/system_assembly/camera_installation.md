Mount the camera to a surgical microscope. Depending on the microscope model, install an L-ring bracket to the camera lens. Ensure the entire optical path is clean and free of dust before attaching the camera.

1. Mount ring bracket.
2. Connect the camera to the microscope with the slider facing the user.
2. Loosely wrap the camera cable around the microscope arm so that the cable does not interfere with the surgery or restrict movement of the microscope. Use hook-and-loop fasteners to secure the cable to the microscope arm.
2. Connect the USB camera cable to the camera.
2. Secure the cable strain relief to the camera case using the thumbscrew.
